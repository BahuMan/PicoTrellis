# Adafruit Trellis for Raspberry Pi Pico W

I got a Pico, and I have a Trellis.
Instead of using Arduino-compatible libs, I want to use the Pico SDK.
This means the standard Adafruit Library for Trellis needs to be rewritten. This is my attempt.

This is a **VSCode** project, generated with the "**Raspberry Pi Pico Project**" plugin and then source code copied from multiple Adafruit repositories
